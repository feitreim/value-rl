## Knowledge base

At the beginning of a conversation, or when asked a new question or told to
work on something new, it is important to first check the knowledge base.

The knowledge base is structered as markdown files inside the /knowledge/
directory. feel free to create new files or add to knowledge base as you see
fit. Frequently update the knowledge_base with the following:

- results of researching online
- optimization methods or approaches you have tried, what works and what doesn't
- plans, todo lists etc.
- anything else you think is relevant.

## Conventions

- Python 3.14, line length 120
- Write clean, simple, readable, idiomatic python, tinygrad style.
- do not error check (no try catch), these are small scripts than run quickly, you should use asserts, to ensure there that it quickly crashes if something is wrong.
- always use uv, uv run train.py etc..
